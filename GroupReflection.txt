The group exercise went well I felt that there was good communication between all of us. Our schedules aligned up relatively 
well as we would usually get into contact with each other during the night time. We would make a zoom call between us and work
on the project as a collective unit. We would refer to the GNU Awk manual and regular expressions tutorial to assist us. We would have
some trouble with the github repository and struggling to add work so we would give awk files to the leader to push them.
