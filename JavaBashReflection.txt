In these programs I was to write a function that takes two dates and returns an integer that would show the number of days 
between the dates. It allows the user to select between the different dates or enter their own. The bash script also counted
the number of days from today and each due date. The date library allowed me to store the date s while the scanner received the 
input from the user while the bash script was able to run the program on its own. They both had the same idea but there was somethings
you could not recreate in bash such as getting the date requested which could then check if maybe it was invalid while bash sees
that as an error.
